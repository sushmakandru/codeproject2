WORD PROBLEM
A disruptive new weather data startup, SkyCast Inc., reached out to you for your help with a small development project. They are looking to change the way people read weather forecasts and would like a stable base to iterate from.

SkyCast is looking to leverage a weather API (https://developer.forecast.io) combined with a geolocation API (https://developers.google.com/maps) to allow users to retrieve current as well as historic data about any location that the users search.

SkyCast would like their users to be able to enter in any location and retrieve current and useful information about the weather in that area. Include charts for historic weather information about that area using any visualization library of your choice, allowing the user to see relevant information within a reasonable time period. Additionally, the team feels that allowing a user to track his or her search history would be a valuable addition, and would like to see a way of storing queries made by a specific user between browser sessions.

Since the project is a prototype, SkyCast looks to you for integrating usable designs and best practices in terms of look and feel into your application. They will also be looking to do a walkthrough of your code with you to gauge how extensible your codebase can be.
â€¨[BONUS] Although not required, the SkyCast team has been looking into various technologies and is interested in practical examples of how to leverage some of them. These include Javascript application frameworks, Javascript testing suites, and resource pre-compilers.
